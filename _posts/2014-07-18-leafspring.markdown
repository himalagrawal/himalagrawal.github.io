<b>Abstract :</b> Leaf springs are a part of the suspension system attached between the axle and the chassis
of the vehicle to support weight and provide shock absorbing capacity of the vehicle. For more than half a century the leaf springs are being made of steel which increases the weight of the vehicle and is prone to rusting and failure. The current study explores the feasibility of composite leaf spring to reduce weight by designing, manufacturing and testing the composite leaf spring for the required load cases.

<b> Brief Summary :</b>
<ul>
  <li>Developed testing fixtures in house using lathe, CNC milling and waterjet for prototype hybrid leaf spring</li>
  <li>Developed composite layup tool using 5-axis CNC and manufactured glass fiber epoxy composite leaf using autoclave </li>
  <li>Performed fatigue testing for different load cases and analysed experimental data from load cell and strain gauges</li>
  <li>The composite leaf spring was lighter by 35% and withstood 1 million cycles without failure</li>
  <li>Designed tests for small scale fatigue testing as a function of aspect ratio of flexure samples to expedite testing</li>
  <li>Explored the fatigue properties of composite beams as a function of aspect ration to characterize shear and bending failure</li>

</ul>
