Due to the signing of an agreement with certain automotive companies photos and files of the projects cannot be shared on a public platform. A brief description of the projects is as follows.
<br>
<br>
 <ul>
  <li>A cast iron rotating object was redesigned for injection molding to reduce weight with same structural rigidity. Geometric modifications in CATIA were done to obtain the same stiffness with glass fiber reinforced injection molding along with structural simulations in Abaqus. Injection molding simulations were then done to study the effect of fiber orientation on the strength of the part</li>
<br>
  <li>A steering column was designed using composites and the effect of material orientation and properties on the natural frequency of the part was studied using Abaqus</li>
</ul>
