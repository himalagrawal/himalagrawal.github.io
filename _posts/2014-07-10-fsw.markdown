<b>Project Details :</b>  Friction stir welding is a solid state joining process that uses frictional heat generated by a rotating tool to join materials. The tool is non-consumable and rotates while rubbing against different pieces of materials which causes the frictional heat to soften the materials and the rotation of the tool mixes the materials resulting in joining or welding when cooled. It is a high strain rate complex deformation process and in the study the process was studies as a CFD phenomenon to predict heat generation and temperature distribution with high viscosity fluid as a function of strain rate. The viscosity of the fluid around the tool was low due to high strain rate and helps in visualization of material mixing. The results obtained by the simulation were experimentally validated from the temperature data obtained from the thermocouple.
