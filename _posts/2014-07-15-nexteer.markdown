<b>Abstract :</b>  The work aimed at developing new composite steering columns that take advantage of the favorable stiffness-to-weight ratio of carbon fiber composites to deliver enhanced performance. The first phase involved the homogenization of material properties for laminate consisting layers of unidirectional pultrusion material, continuous filament mat and biaxial carbon fabric. A sensitivity study was then done to find the change in natural frequencies as a function of pultruded angle, thickness and different material properties using Abaqus. A python code coupled with Abaqus was developed to automate the process of changing material properties and writing required results to a user specified file eliminating the use of graphical user interface and manual labor.

<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Initially performed natural frequency analysis using Abaqus for provided original model using Abaqus without composites to find first 3 natural frequencies</li>
  <li>Fixed the errors in the Abaqus model for successfully finding the natural frequencies of the column</li>
  <li>Found the homogenized material properties for laminates consisting of pultrusion layer, continuous filament mat and biaxial carbon fabric using classical laminate plate theory</li>
  <li>Used the material properties in Abaqus model to find the change in natural frequencies with change in material properties</li>
  <li>Performed a sensitivity study to study change in natural frequencies as a function of different material properties and analyzing the part having the maximum effect</li>
  <li>The work was automated using Python coding coupled with Abaqus which made necessary changes to the Abaqus input file, ran the simulations, extracted the results and wrote them to a specific file without the need of graphical user interface and manual labor</li>
</ul>
