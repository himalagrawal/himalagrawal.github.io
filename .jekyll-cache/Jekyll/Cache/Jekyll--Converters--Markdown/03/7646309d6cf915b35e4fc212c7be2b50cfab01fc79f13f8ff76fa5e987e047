Matternet is a Mountain View, CA based startup operating in USA and Switzerland in the field of autonomous drone logistics system. It provides an end-to-end solution integrating the Matternet M2 Drone, the Matternet Station and the Matternet Cloud Platform.
<br />
<br />
My role at Matternet is a combination of hardware design and programming. I am familiar with python and C++ programming languages. A brief summary of my work is as follows.
<ul>
  <li>Developed a test for measuring motor vibration and imbalance using accelerometer, loadcell and analyzing data using Fourier transform in python</li>
  <li>Analyzed and compared NI load cell data acquisition systems and led the final procurement of the data acquisition system</li>
  <li>Made windows apps using kivy in python for technicians to facilitate easy testing of hardware. The app issued mavlink commands via hard wired links and were used for batch motor and esc qualification, parachute deployment fuse test and complete vehicle test before deployment</li>
  <li>Integrated the load cell and accelerometer data into the motor test windows app using python for a complete automated test with just one button click</li>
  <li>Modified designs and assembly for the drone using Solidworks PDM</li>
  <li>Performed structural simulation of drone fairings, calculations for minimum deployable height and systems level test for electrical components</li>
  <li>Enhanced understanding of Ardupilot code and functioning, mavExplorer, mavProxy, mavlink, flight logs</li>

</ul>

Only a few work images can be shared due to confidentiality issues. The image in figure 1 shows an interface of the windows app made using kivy in python which is used for batch motor and esc testing and qualification before fitting in the actual vehicles. Required values are input in accordance to a predetermined profile shown in figure 2 leading to running of motors with the load cell and accelerometer data acquisition in the background all with a single button click.
<br />
<br />
Other apps for testing the parachute deployment system and full vehicle test before deployment were made for easy testing by concerened personnel.
