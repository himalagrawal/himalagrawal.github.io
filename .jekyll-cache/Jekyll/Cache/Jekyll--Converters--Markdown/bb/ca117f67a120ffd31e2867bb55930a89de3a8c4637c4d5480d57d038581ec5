<b>Abstract :</b> Feasibility of polymer composite material pulley viable for John Deere high power belt drive in tractors was studied. The increase in maintenance difficulties for cast iron pulley being heavy led to the decision to design lighter glass giber reinforced injection molded pulley offering the same stiffness, strength, fatigue properties and resistance to creep. Structural simulations were done from the given loading conditions and the geometry was redesigned to obtain the stresses and strains in the required range and favorable geometry which could be injection molded. Injection molding simulations were then done to find the fiber orientations, warpage, air gaps, weld lines from flow and the effect of these fiber orientations on the final strength of the part.
<br />
<br />
<b> Brief Summary :</b>
<ul>
  <li>Performed literature review and patent search on existing available composite pulleys designs</li>
  <li>Performed structural simulations for given load cases using Abaqus and redesigned the pulley assembly within the design space to account for stresses and strains</li>
  <li>Explored the effects of ribbing, hybrid compression molding with carbon fabric and change in geometry on stresses and strains</li>
  <li>Designed the gating channels, cooling channels, molds and process conditions for an initial injection molding simulation</li>
  <li>Performed injection molding simulations using Moldex3D to determine flow induced glass fiber orientations and characterize warpage, residual stresses, air traps, weld lines and flow front progress </li>
  <li>Performed structural simulation in Abaqus with flow induced glass fiber orientations as input to Abaqus model to analyze the effect of fiber orientations on stresses and strains </li>
  <li>An increase in stresses by 14% was observed due to orientation induced directional strength from glass fibers</li>
  <li>The final design was lighter by 71% from 105 lb to 30.23 lb</li>

</ul>
