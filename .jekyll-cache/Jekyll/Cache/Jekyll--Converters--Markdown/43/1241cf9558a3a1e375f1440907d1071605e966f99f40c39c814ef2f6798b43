Helped a team of undergraduate students for the student design project to manufacture a composite bicycle saddle for improved rider load pressure distribution and improved ergonomics. My role in the project was to help them make tools for the composite layup using CNC machining. I created the geometry and machined the part using 3 axis CNC machine from the generated tool path in CATIA V5. The images of the tools are as follows.
