<b>Abstract :</b> The work presented was a joint effort of above mentioned students as the final project for Manufacturing of Composites 590 grad class at Purdue University. In the aerospace industry, ever higher strength-to-weight ratios are naturally sought. This has led to wider use of composite components throughout the aircraft. The most common, traditional methods for composite manufacturing tend to be slow and expensive, however. Part layup and curing times make even small parts take longer to manufacture than cast parts or weldments made of metal. Laminated composites also provide limits on part complexity, drastically reducing the design space allowed for engineers. Compression molding of composites provides a reasonable alternative that allows for relatively quick manufacturing times while also providing possibilities for complex geometries.
<br />
In the current project an engineered preform is designed in this experiment to accommodate a given part geometry. This experiment is the synthesis of many of the principles of composite manufacturing. An initial layup of the charge is determined using a stress and failure analysis. Experiments on the curing behavior of the resin system are employed in defining a cure cycle. The cycle is chosen to provide the ideal properties for resin and fiber flow, while trying to maintain an appropriate fiber volume fraction and minimize material lost due to flash. The parts are then manufactured and tested to evaluate their overall strength.
<br />
<br />
<b> Brief Summary :</b>
<ul>
  <li>The project aimed at creating a part with highest strength to weight ratio for a particular loading and geometry by using engineering knowledge to make changes in process conditions and preform design. The geometry is of a part flying on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner</li>
  <li>Stress analysis for isotropic conditions and ply orientation analysis was performed using Abaqus to minimize the Tsai-Wu failure criteria which led to selection of [0/45/-45/90]2s ply orientation for compression molding</li>
  <li>Cure cycle was determined from experimental DSC experiments and preforms were cut on a CNC Gerber cutter with half inch cuts in the plies to improve fiber flow</li>
  <li>One of the part was made with through thickness fiber reinforcements to study if the interlaminar failure can be avoided using fiber reinforcements in compression molding</li>
  <li>Mechanical tensile test was performed to observe the maximum load carried by part and the failure locations</li>
  <li>Microscopy was performed on failed parts to observe the fiber flow in compression molding and obtain insights into failure mechanisms</li>
