                    <p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >There are two types of engineers in the world: Those who work in their comfort zones and the others who take risk and challenges and constantly keep on learning to make themselves better. I belive myself to be the second kind. I always look forward to staying updated with emerging technology and contribute to projects in making a difference.  </p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >My interest in Mechanical Design started in undergrad as a part of Formula Student team where I along with my team designed and implemented an electro-pneumatic gear shifting mechanism at one third of the market available product. My project on numerical simulation of Friction Stir Welding in my junior year also received widespread appreciation and won me $3500 from ASME IDETC/CIE conference in North Carolina, USA. With the vision of expanding my knowledge and howrizons I then joined Purdue University for masters in Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering with major in structures and minor in controls.  </p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >My experience in grad school consists of all phases of product development using composites to achieve a lighter and better performing structure. It consisted of the design phase using CATIA, Solidworkds and then simulating the part using Abaqus followed by manufacturing and testing the part along with experimental validation of simulation. My masters thesis consisted of designing, manufacturing and testing of composite leaf spring of Ford F-150. I have also worked on industrial projects from Ford, John Deere and Nexteer Automotive to design and implement composite parts.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >Last but not the least I am interested in electronics and my minor is in control systems. I am proficient with programming microcontrollers (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Interrupts) and assembly level programming. As part of controls project I implemented a cruise control algorithm on a model steam engine. Also, for my embedded systems project I developed a quadcopter from off the shelf components which could perform facial recognition. I now aim to make the quadcopter completely autonomous. I am also passionate about evolving technologies like machine learning and have done course in machine learning by coursera and currently exploring deep learning. </p>
