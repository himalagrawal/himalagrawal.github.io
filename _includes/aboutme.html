                    <p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >There are two types of engineers in the world: Those who work in their comfort zones and the others who take risk, challenges and constantly keep on learning to make themselves better. I believe myself to be the second kind. I always look forward to staying updated with emerging technology and contribute to projects in making a difference.  </p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >My interest in Mechanical Design started in undergrad as a part of Formula Student team where I along with my team designed and implemented an electro-pneumatic gear shifting mechanism at one third of the market available product. My project on numerical simulation of Friction Stir Welding in my junior year also received widespread appreciation and won me $3500 from ASME IDETC/CIE conference in North Carolina, USA. With the vision of expanding my knowledge and horizons I then joined Purdue University for masters in Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering with major in structures and minor in controls.  </p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >My experience in grad school consists of all phases of product development using composites to achieve a lighter and better performing structure. It consists of the design phase using CATIA, Solidworks and then simulating the part using Abaqus followed by manufacturing and testing the part for experimental validation of simulation. My masters thesis consisted of designing, manufacturing and testing of composite leaf spring of Ford F-150. I have also worked on Department of Energy sponsored industrial projects from Ford, John Deere and Nexteer Automotive to design and build composite parts for lighter automotive structures.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px; word-spacing: 1px;" class="text-muted" >Last but not the least I am interested in electronics and my minor is in control systems. I am proficient with programming microcontrollers (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Interrupts) and assembly level programming. As part of controls project I implemented a cruise control algorithm on a model engine. Also, for my embedded systems project we developed a quadcopter from off the shelf components which could perform facial recognition for surveillance purposes. I now aim to make the quadcopter fully or semi-autonomous along with object detection using Lidar. I am also passionate about evolving technologies like machine learning and have done course in machine learning by coursera and currently exploring deep learning. </p>
